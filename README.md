# Boids_AgentBasedSimulation
Austin Hyatt
class project for IMGD 4000 simulating the boids flocking algorithm in unreal engine 5 with C++

Implemented 3 rules for emergent flocking behavior
- Rule 1: Boids try to fly towards the center of mass of neighbouring boids.
- Rule 2: Boids try to keep a small distance away from other boids.
- Rule 3: Boids try to match velocity with nearby boids.

Implemented further tweaks
- Limiting Maximum Speed of boids
- Bounding the position of boids within a box
